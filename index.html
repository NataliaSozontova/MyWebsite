<h2>Why I am here</h2>

<p>I always wanted to be in the IT field. First, I wanted to become a Network Engineer or get into Cyber Security and even got Cisco CCNA certification  but, I changed my mind and decided to dive into coding 
    world and learned Java and other tools. 
    As for today, I am working as an SDET, and while writing the automation test scripts for the Software application, I have to analyze the front and back end of it. I also like to learn something new constantly, and 
    GW Bootcamp program has a list of tools matching my current project, so I decided to go for it.
    On top of it, I would like to improve my code structure and logic to design a clean, reusable code. </p>
